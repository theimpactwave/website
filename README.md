### 1. About

The Impact Wave - https://theimpactwave.org "Unleash your generosity - Amplify your giving"

**Welcome to the impact wave.** We aim to be the first blockchain based impact DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organisation)
dedicated to revolutionize the funding and investment process of projects and initiatives in the technical development
and NGO realm.

We believe that the funding methods commonly used and implemented today are not not sufficient enough to generate a bigger
impact today then they did decades ago. Our research has shown that in ever more rapidly growing world the typical grant
funding scheme fails to develop the power and speed necessary to really amplify to positive impact of projects and initiatives

On the core of the established grant funding processes is the believe that we invest for results. This common believe
creates levels of dependency for the actual impact makers (the change makers the run the projects) to a) struggle to get
funding b) proof results and c) keep the funding alive for further growth. The problems of this approach for low-level,
smaller or start-up initiatives can be listed as such:

- Without a network (contacts and peers) no grant funding
- Without a reputation and trust level no network
- Grant funding is a tedious process - it takes a lot of time and effort to get funds
- The funding is tied to a specific purpose and results and can not adopt to changes
- evaluation is not generalized and can become complex for small initiatives
- The evaluation is too technical or bureaucratic
- Struggle to get follow-up funding and keep the initiatives up and running
- Low appreciation level because no project visibility

Our research has shown that getting funding and the way funding tied to a specific goal in time is the most biggest
pain point for local change makers. Therefore we challenge the common believe:

**We invest in processes not results**

We aim to continuously fund local change making processes to generate the highest impact on the long run. We believe
in the power, vision and engagement of our local change makers and support the ongoing engagement be supplying a basic
continuous appreciation funding not tied to concrete results in time but tied to the positive impact "story" that our change
makers generate.

The impact story is the narrative that develops by the changes that our local impact makers and initiatives generate.
In a social cultural context the narrative of the entity pushing for a change and the entities affected by the change give
a realistic image of the positive impact the changes generate.

We bridge the on/off grant funding scheme, or better said we close the grant funding gap and keep the local change makers
and initiatives up and running. By doing so we not only lower the barriers for the full unfolding of impact potential, but
also encourage the local impact makers peers and environment to follow suit and foster a local "strive for positive change"
culture.

We close the appreciation gap the traditional grant funding eventually produces and can not or is not willing to close.
